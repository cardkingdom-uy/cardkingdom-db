# cardkingdom-db

Main goal of these scripts is to maintain an up-to-date MTG cards database, including their market prices. We'll also try to keep an already generated and up-to-date _export.sql_ file (includes the database structure and all it's processed records ready to insert)

Latest _export.sql_ file can be downloaded [here](http://cattaneo.uy/private/export.sql.zip)

## generate.py
"JSON to MySql-database" python3 script for all current MTG cards. This is possible thanks to http://mtgjson.com/ (v4)
